# Image Converter

You have probably experienced downloading an image from the internet and found the image to be a format that doesn't fit your need. I used to use photoshop or gimp to convert them to the format that I needed, but now I just use this image converter.

## How to use

1. Open the program, both work in the exact same way, it's just a matter of preference
2. Choose the file format that you want
3. Drop the file or files in the window
4. You're done
